		<h1>Working with Geodata inside Salesforce </h1>
        <h2>What is salesforce</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Company.</li>
            <li>Best and most used CRM</li>
            <li>Great cloud platform for Web Development</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Auditory: Compare Salesforce to Amazon.
        </p>

        <h2>Salesforce as a platform</h2>
        
        <p>
            Salesforce is not a GIS.
        </p>
        <p>
            But spatial data is so important, that Salesforce has several important buid in features 
            for work with spatial data. <br>
            They are:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Address data type</li>
            <li>Location data type</li>
            <li>Distance function</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>
            Address data type
        </h2>

        <p>
            Note: for some reason it is not normalized.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Location data type
        </h2>
        <p>
            Picture - example
        </p>

        <h2>Distance function</h2>
        <p>
            Picture - example
        </p>

        <h2>
            Salesforce Maps
        </h2>

        <p>
            Salesforce Maps - is additional platform feature (separate licence is needed).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Previously Salesforce maps was wrapper on Google Maps.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But with intruduction of Field Service Ligtning (and may be other reasons), 
            new maps, based on ESRI ones were integrated.
        </p>

        <h2>Salesforce projects</h2>
        <p>
            Salesforce allows to impmement any web-project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course many of them are CRM related.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally, during my almost 5-year Experience in Salesforce, I've contributed to nearly dozen of projects.<br>
            Two of them were a bit related to using spatial data.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Second project (details are under NDA)
        </h2>
        <p>
            One of features: ranking, where distance was one of factors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note for future devs - nice task:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>REST API - secured</li>
            <li>Implemented Comparable And Iterable interfaces for sorting and Ranking</li>
            <li>Serialization workaround</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            well organized project:
        </h2>
        <li>
            <li>CI (Including descructive changes)</li>
            <li>Static Analisys</li>                 
        </li>

        <p>Why salesforce platform is great?</p>
        <p>
            Some details for ones, alrady taken cource "GIS-programming"
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the oldest cloud</li>
            <li>API first design for any integration</li>
            <li>A lot of features already implemented</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Development
        </h2>

        <p>All possiblitites for Development</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>No Code</li>
            <li>Visual Code</li>
            <li>Low Code</li>
            <li>A lot of code</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            And that's why platform is great for the newcomers:
            Not steep learning curve.
        </p>
